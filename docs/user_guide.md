## Introduction

ColBuilder is a specialized tool for generating atomistic models of collagen microfibrils from single collagen molecules. It offers a comprehensive pipeline for creating detailed, biologically relevant collagen structures for use in molecular dynamics simulations and structural studies.

### What is ColBuilder?

ColBuilder enables researchers to:
- Generate atomistic models of collagen microfibrils with precise control over their geometric features
- Customize collagen structures with different crosslink types and configurations
- Create models for various species (human, bovine, rodent, and more)
- Prepare structures for molecular dynamics simulations

### Pipeline Overview

ColBuilder implements a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Sequence Generation (Homology Modeling)**: Creates a collagen triple helix based on sequence information
2. **Geometry Generation**: Builds a microfibril structure with specified dimensions and properties
3. **Topology Generation**: Prepares files for molecular dynamics simulations

Each stage can be run independently or as a complete pipeline, allowing flexibility in your workflow.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

Create a basic configuration file named `config.yaml`:

```yaml
# Basic human collagen microfibril configuration
species: "homo_sapiens"
sequence_generator: true
geometry_generator: true
crosslink: true
fibril_length: 60.0
contact_distance: 20
n_term_type: "HLKNL"
c_term_type: "HLKNL"
n_term_combination: "9.C - 947.A"
c_term_combination: "1047.C - 104.C"
```

Run ColBuilder:
```bash
colbuilder --config_file config.yaml
```

This command will generate a collagen microfibril for human (homo_sapiens) collagen with HLKNL crosslinks.

### Understanding the Output

After successful execution, ColBuilder will generate several output files:

- **Sequence Generation Output:**
  - `{species}_alignment.fasta`: Multiple sequence alignment file
  - `{species}_N_{n_term_type}_C_{c_term_type}.pdb`: PDB file of the collagen triple helix

- **Geometry Generation Output:**
  - `collagen_fibril_{species}.pdb`: PDB file of the collagen microfibril

- **Topology Generation Output (if enabled):**
  - `{species}_topology_files/`: Directory containing topology files
  - `collagen_fibril_{species}.top`: Topology file
  - `collagen_fibril_{species}.gro`: GROMACS coordinate file

## Basic Workflows

### 1. Full Pipeline: Sequence to Topology

This workflow runs the complete pipeline from sequence to topology:

```yaml
# config_full.yaml
species: "homo_sapiens"
sequence_generator: true
geometry_generator: true
topology_generator: true
crosslink: true
n_term_type: "HLKNL"
c_term_type: "HLKNL"
n_term_combination: "9.C - 947.A"
c_term_combination: "1047.C - 104.C"
fibril_length: 60.0
contact_distance: 20
force_field: "amber99"
```

```bash
colbuilder --config_file config_full.yaml
```

### 2. Only Sequence Generation

This workflow only generates the collagen triple helix:

```yaml
# config_sequence.yaml
species: "homo_sapiens"
sequence_generator: true
geometry_generator: false
topology_generator: false
crosslink: true
n_term_type: "HLKNL"
c_term_type: "HLKNL"
n_term_combination: "9.C - 947.A"
c_term_combination: "1047.C - 104.C"
```

```bash
colbuilder --config_file config_sequence.yaml
```

### 3. Only Geometry Generation

This workflow generates the microfibril geometry from an existing PDB:

```yaml
# config_geometry.yaml
species: "homo_sapiens"
sequence_generator: false
geometry_generator: true
topology_generator: false
pdb_file: "path/to/triple_helix.pdb"
fibril_length: 60.0

## Working with Different Species

ColBuilder supports generating collagen structures for a variety of species:

### Supported Species

- **Mammals (Primates)**: homo_sapiens, pan_troglodytes, pongo_abelii, callithrix_jacchus, otolemur_garnettii
- **Mammals (Rodents)**: mus_musculus, rattus_norvegicus
- **Mammals (Other)**: bos_taurus, canis_lupus, ailuropoda_melanoleuca, mustela_putorius, myotis_lucifugus, loxodonta_africana
- **Fish**: danio_rerio, oreochromis_niloticus, oryzias_latipes, tetraodon_nigroviridis, xiphophorus_maculatus
- **Reptiles**: pelodiscus_sinensis

### Species-Specific Configuration

Different species have different residue combinations available for crosslinking. When configuring crosslinks, ensure you use valid combinations for your chosen species. Here are some examples:

#### Human (homo_sapiens)

```yaml
species: "homo_sapiens"
n_term_type: "HLKNL"
c_term_type: "HLKNL"
n_term_combination: "9.C - 947.A"
c_term_combination: "1047.C - 104.C"
```

#### Bovine (bos_taurus)

```yaml
species: "bos_taurus"
n_term_type: "HLKNL"
c_term_type: "HLKNL"
n_term_combination: "9.C - 946.A"
c_term_combination: "1046.C - 103.C"
```

#### Using Custom Sequences

For species not in the predefined list, provide a custom FASTA file:

```yaml
species: "custom_species"
fasta_file: "path/to/custom_sequence.fasta"
sequence_generator: true
crosslink: false
# Other parameters as needed
```

Crosslinks definition for custom_species must be added to the file in src/colbuilder/data/sequence/crosslinks.csv

## Customizing Collagen Structures

### Crosslink Types

ColBuilder supports various crosslink types found in collagen:

- **HLKNL**: Hydroxylysino-5-ketonorleucine (divalent crosslink)
- **LKNL**: Lysino-5-ketonorleucine (divalent)
- **PYD**: Pyridinoline (trivalent)
- **DPD**: Deoxypyridinoline (trivalent)
- **PYL**: Pyrrole crosslink (trivalent)
- **DPL**: (trivalent)
- **deHHLNL**: Dehydro-hydroxylysino-norleucine (divalent)
- **deHLNL**: Dehydro-lysino-norleucine (divalent)
- **NOCROSS**: No crosslinking
- **Glucosepane**: Advanced glycation end-product crosslink (specific species)

Each crosslink type can be positioned in a few combination of selected Lysine residues, depending on the species being modeled. All available crosslinks and respective combinations for each species are listed at [src/colbuilder/data/sequence/crosslinks.csv](https://github.com/graeter-group/colbuilder/blob/main/src/colbuilder/data/sequence/crosslinks.csv)

### Fibril Dimensions

Control the size of your microfibril using these parameters:

```yaml
contact_distance: 20        # Controls radial size (larger values produce thicker fibrils)
fibril_length: 60.0         # Controls fibril length in nanometers
```

### Optimizing Crystal Contacts

For better-packed microfibrils, enable crystal contact optimization:

```yaml
crystalcontacts_optimize: true
solution_space: [1, 1, 1]   # Solution space for optimization [d_x, d_y, d_z]
```

## Advanced Features

### Mixing Crosslink Types

To create a heterogeneous microfibril with different crosslink types:

```yaml
mix_bool: true
ratio_mix: "D:70 T:30"      # 70% type D, 30% type T
files_mix:
 - "human-D.pdb"            # triple helix PDB with type D crosslinks
 - "human-T.pdb"            # triple helix PDB with type T crosslinks
```

This feature allows modeling of collagen structures with a mixture of crosslink types.

### Replacing Crosslinks

To model partially crosslinked collagen (replacing some crosslinks with standard lysines):

```yaml
replace_bool: true
ratio_replace: 30                   # Replace 30% of crosslinks with lysines
replace_file: "original_fibril.pdb" # PDB with original collagen microfibril structure
```

### Using Different Force Fields

For molecular dynamics simulations, ColBuilder supports multiple force fields:

```yaml
topology_generator: true
force_field: "amber99"      # For all-atom simulations
```

```yaml
topology_generator: true
force_field: "martini3"     # For coarse-grained simulations
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. PyMOL Issues

**Error:** "PyMOL not found" or library-related errors

**Solution:**
```bash
conda install conda-forge::pymol-open-source
conda install -c conda-forge libnetcdf==4.7.3
```

#### 2. UCSF Chimera Issues

**Error:** "Chimera not found" or scripts not running

**Solutions:**
- Ensure UCSF Chimera (not ChimeraX) is installed
- Add Chimera to your PATH
- Check that Chimera scripts are in the expected directory

#### 3. Modeller Issues

**Error:** Import errors with Modeller

**Solutions:**
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure you're using Modeller 10.5 specifically
- Check the Modeller license key is properly installed

#### 4. Sequence Generation Errors

**Error:** "Sequence generation failed" or "Crosslink application failed"

**Solutions:**
- Verify species name is correctly spelled
- Ensure crosslink combinations are valid for the species
- Check that fasta_file path is correct if using a custom sequence

#### 5. Geometry Generation Errors

**Error:** "Geometry generation failed" or "Invalid contact distance"

**Solutions:**
- Ensure contact_distance is positive and reasonable (typically 15-25)
- Verify the input PDB file exists and is valid
- Check fibril_length is within reasonable limits (typically 30-334)

#### 6. Topology Generation Errors

**Error:** "Topology generation failed" or "Invalid force field"

**Solutions:**
- Verify force_field is either "amber99" or "martini3"
- Ensure GROMACS is installed if using amber99
- Check that Martinize2 is installed if using martini3

### Debugging

To enable detailed logging:

```bash
colbuilder --config_file config.yaml --debug
```

This will provide more information about what's happening during execution and save all intermediate files.

## Best Practices

### Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Larger - especially in diameter - fibrils require significant memory. Start with smaller fibril_length values (contact_distance: 20-60 Ang) before attempting larger structures.
- **Processing Time**: Sequence generation with crosslink optimization is one of the most time-consuming steps. Consider running this step separately and reusing the output for multiple geometry variations.

### Workflow Recommendations

1. **Iterative Approach**: Start with sequence generation only, validate the output, then proceed to geometry and topology generation.
   
2. **Validation at Each Step**: Visualize the output of each stage with molecular visualization software like PyMOL or VMD to ensure correctness.

3. **Parameter Exploration**: Test different contact_distance values to find the optimal radial packing for your system.

## Next Steps

After generating your collagen microfibril:

### Visualization

Visualize your structures using molecular visualization software:

```bash
vmd collagen_fibril_homo_sapiens.pdb
```

### Molecular Dynamics Simulations

If you've generated topology files, you can proceed to molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS:

1. **Energy Minimization**
2. **Equilibration**
3. **Production Runs**

Refer to the GROMACS documentation for detailed instructions.

### Analysis

Analyze your collagen structure:
- Crosslink distribution and geometry
- Fibril packing and density
- Mechanical properties through simulations

### Extensions

ColBuilder can be extended to:
- Study the effects of mutations on collagen structure
- Model disease-relevant modifications
